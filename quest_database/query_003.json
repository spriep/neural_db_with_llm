    "expected_result": "Clone is not a token. A clone copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or auras. You may choose only a creature that’s already on the battlefield for a clone to copy. You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Clone enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately. You can choose to copy another clone.",
